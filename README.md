# Dr Aminu Usman 
# Embedded System Security


# Overview of the session

To understand the principles of Embedded System Security through the completion of the following tasks:

*	Build an Xbee network, consisting of sender and receiver nodes.
*	Configure security settings on the Xbee network.
*	Build a LoRa network, consisting of sender and receiver nodes.
*	Convert the LoRa system into LoRaWAN and configure the security settings.
*	Attempt to disrupt Xbee/LoRa network traffic using Denial of Service methods.
*	Attempt to capture Xbee/LoRa traffic using eavesdropping methods.
*	Use the HackRF for the denial of service and eavesdropping.
*	Optional: Complete individual tasks at the end of the workshop.

## Overview of the session 
The tutorial will present you on how to develop multiple embedded systems and configure their security. You will then attempt different security penetration techniques on these systems and review their outcome.

## Requirements 

Students would be required to access a computer system, internet connectivity, and access privilege to download and install applications during the session. The following list contains the equipment required to complete all of the tasks.
