## Introduction to Embedded Systems

An embedded system is usually formed of a microprocessor-based computer which is designed to perform a specific function. The complexity of a system like this can range from a simple one with couple to no peripherals/sensors, to a large one used for managing industrial jobs.

The first modern, real-time embedded computing system was the Apollo Guidance Computer, developed in the 1960s by Dr. Charles Stark Draper at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the Apollo Program. The Apollo Guidance Computer was designed to collect data automatically and provide mission-critical calculations for the Apollo Command Module and Lunar Module. The microcontroller-based embedded systems would go on to be incorporated into every aspect of consumersâ€™ daily lives, from credit card readers and cell phones to traffic lights and thermostats.

## Embedded System Security

Embedded systems security is a cybersecurity field focused on preventing malicious access to and use of embedded systems. Embedded systems security provides mechanisms to protect a system from all types of malicious behaviour.

To prevent attacks on embedded systems, these conditions should be followed:

*	Expect firmware to be updated regularly.
*	Limit access to embedded systems to a need-to-use basis.
*	Provide a way for network administrators to monitor connections to and from embedded systems.
*	Allow integration with third-party security management systems.
